Our project basically aims to monitor dry soil condition monitoring in a
vast region which is replaced here as a prototype with three moisture
sensors . It will engage the users as well as automatic selection for
which data they want to see in the “ARDUTOOTH” app via bluetooth
module. Here the challenging part was the multiplexing and demultiplexing.
There is an interesting part which plays a wav type sound to
alert the user about the dry condition of the soil.
